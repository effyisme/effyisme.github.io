      <h1>Affirmations</h1>
      <p class="subtle">Click a category below to recall your truths.</p>
      
      <div class="card">
        <button class="collapsible">I know people will think I'm pathetic</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
          <p>Wait. Let's be gentle here, both with me and with them.
            Right now, I am assuming I know exactly what is in their minds. But am I a mind reader? No. I am hurting myself with a story that I've invented.
            Let's look at the facts. They are not my jury; they are just people living their own lives, wrapped up in their own worries and thoughts. How much time did I spend today thinking about someone else's awkward moment? Probably zero. They don't care about me as much as my anxiety tells me they do. Their world doesn't revolve around me, and that is a relief. It's freedom.
            Did I notice someone sitting alone at lunch yesterday? Maybe. If I did, what did I think? Did I feel negative towards them? No. I probably thought, 'Oh, they're having a quiet lunch,' and then I immediately went back to worrying about my own life. That's just normal.
        </p>
            <p>And let's be kind to them, too. If they didn't invite me to do something fun, it's not a secret message that they hate me. It's a fact of busy lives. People forget. People get distracted. It doesn't mean I am disliked; it simply means I was not at the front of their mind in that moment. That's okay. If I want to be included, I can also take a small step to connect later.
            So right now, I will let go of the story I'm telling myself about them. I will focus on the only thing I can know for sure: my own intentions. My intention is to be kind. If being quiet and taking my time is my true self in this moment, then I will let it be. I will be here, as I am, without apology."

      <div class="card">
        <button class="collapsible">I disappointed that important person</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
          <p>I am listening for information about the task, not for a verdict on me. What is the specific problem that needs to be solved? What is the action that was done incorrectly?
            I'm learning and growing, and mistakes are part of that process
        </p>
            <p>If someone is loud or bitter to you: I wonder what is causing this strong reaction in them? They must be under a lot of stress. Perhaps they were treated this way and don't know another way to communicate. 
                Their harsh words say more about their stress/communication style than my worth.
               it's probably about their own stress and learned communication patterns.

        <button class="collapsible">I feel myself trying to hard for approval</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
          <p>I see you, trying so hard to get it right. I see the effort you're putting in to be seen as competent and valuable. Let's take a moment and be gentle here.
            This feeling of pressure isn't a sign that you're failing; it's a sign that you care deeply. And that is a wonderful quality.
            But right now, let's let go of the need to impress. Impressing others is exhausting, and it's not where your true power lies. Your power isn't in a perfect performance; it's in your quiet competence. It's in the good work you do every single day.
            Your boss doesn't need a dazzling show. They need your thoughtful, reliable work. You've already earned your place here through your skills and your dedication, not through your ability to say the perfect thing in this one moment.
            So, let's shift the goal. The goal is not to impress.</p>
            <p>It's okay to be solid, steady, and quiet. It's okay to be you. Your best work comes from a place of calm, not from a place of pressure. Let's return to that calm now.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <button class="collapsible">I'm carefully crafting all the conversation
        </button>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
          <p>Wait. This thought that just popped into my head—this is my authentic self trying to connect.
            Being in my head, planning the perfect sentence, is where the anxiety lives. Being in the conversation, sharing the first thing that comes to mind, is where the flow is. That is me being real.
            A conversation is not a performance. It doesn't need a script. It needs genuine contributions, even if they are imperfect. An awkward or simple contribution is better than the perfect contribution that never gets said.</p>
            <p>My goal is not to impress everyone. My goal is to add to the energy of the conversation. Sharing this thought is how I do that.
            I will trust my first thought. I will say it, even if my voice shakes a little. I am choosing to be present in this conversation, not a prisoner in my own mind</p>
        </div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <button class="collapsible">Why I can't be like others...</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
            <p>Wait. Let's remember who I really am.
                I know that person I was on my carefree day. I genuinely love her. She is not a stranger; she is me.
                On that day, I was happy. I was present. I was effortlessly kind to people, not because I was trying to perform, but because that's who I am when I'm not afraid. I deserve to feel that way more often. I deserve her.
                This anxiety, this fear of being boring or saying the wrong thing, is just a cloud passing in front of that person. It is not the sky.
                I know what will happen. Nothing will happen like I fear. The catastrophe I'm imagining is a phantom. It's a story I suffer from in my head, not in reality.
                And I know that people love authenticity. I do too. I love it when people are real, when they're a little awkward, when they're just... them. It gives me permission to be me. By being brave enough to be my authentic self right now—even if it's quiet, even if it's imperfect—I am giving someone else permission to be themselves too.
                So my goal right now is not to be perfect. It is to be authentic. I will be kind to myself, take one small step, and let the real me have a chance to show up.</p>
            <p>When you genuinely enjoy reading your Kindle alone at lunch, that's not something to fix or apologize for. That's you honoring what actually brings you peace and joy.
            There's this beautiful freedom in recognizing that your way of being social might look different from others, and that's completely valid. Some people recharge by being the loudest voice in group conversations. Others contribute through thoughtful listening, well-timed questions, or quiet presence. Both are valuable ways to connect.
            The key distinction is asking yourself: "Am I doing this because I want to, or because I'm afraid?" When you choose to read alone because you love that quiet time with a good book - that's self-respect. When you sit alone because you're convinced everyone will reject you - that's anxiety talking.
            
            
            Same with conversations. If you're naturally more of a listener who chimes in thoughtfully rather than dominating the discussion, that's your communication style. Some of the most magnetic people I know are the ones who make others feel heard rather than trying to be the entertainment.
            
            I am not a boring person; I am a person who has been afraid to share. I am now learning how to share, one small step at a time.
            
            Your preferences matter. Your way of moving through the world matters. You don't need to perform extroversion to prove your worth. The goal isn't to become someone else - it's to become more authentically yourself, whether that's quiet or loud, solitary or social, funny or thoughtful.
            Trust that inner voice that knows what actually feels good to you. It's usually wiser than the anxious voice telling you to fit in.

                <div class="collapsible-content"><div>
                  <p>Sharing a piece of my life does not make me an attention-seeker; it makes me human.
                    I am allowed to take up space. I am allowed to share what brings me joy. I don't need to shrink myself to make others comfortable. If this feels true to who I am, then it's not fake.
                    I'm not performing for strangers—I'm documenting my life for me. I'd rather be seen as 'extra' than feel invisible.</p>
                    <p>The people who genuinely care about me want to see me happy and expressed. They will not be put off by my joy. Anyone who finds my joy 'obnoxious' is revealing something about themselves, not me.
                    So, right now, I am giving myself permission to be seen. I am sharing this because it brings me joy, and my joy is valid and worthy of being expressed.
